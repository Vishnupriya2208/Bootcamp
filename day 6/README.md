 üìå Task 1: Analyze `robots.txt` for Amazon, ESPNCricInfo, and Instagram  

üîç Overview  
This task involves analyzing the `robots.txt` files of **Amazon, ESPNcricinfo, and Instagram** to understand the limits set by these websites for web scraping. The `robots.txt` file defines which parts of a website can be accessed by web crawlers and which are restricted.

| `robots_instagram.txt` | Extracted `robots.txt` file of Instagram |
| `README.md` | Task description and details |

 üìä Data Description  

Each `robots.txt` file contains directives that specify:  
- **Allowed paths**: Sections that can be crawled.  
- **Disallowed paths**: Sections that are restricted from web crawlers.  
- **User-agent directives**: Specific instructions for different search engines and bots.  
- **Crawl-delay (if any)**: Specifies how frequently bots should make requests.  

üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Perform  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fetch `robots.txt` files**: Use Python's `requests` module to fetch `robots.txt` from each website.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze Directives**:  
   - Identify `User-agent` rules.  
   - List `Disallow` and `Allow` rules.  
   - Check for `Crawl-delay`.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Summarize Findings**:  
   - Compare the level of restriction for different websites.  
   - Identify whether scraping is allowed or heavily restricted.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualize Restrictions** (Optional): Create a table or word cloud to highlight blocked sections.
